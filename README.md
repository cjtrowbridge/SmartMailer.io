# SmartMailer.io
I built a tool very similar to this one as an experiment to see how much money I could bring in to a previous workplace by sending automated emails based on various criteria. The answer turned out to be millions and millions of dollars.

I have deliberately left several small sections of this code incomplete in order to prevent accidental misuse. This code is very simple but extremely powerful and it would be very easy to accidentally use it in a way which violates laws all over the world.

You MUST research the legal requirements in your jurisdiction before using any part of this project, and make sure you have unambiguous and clear consent as required by law before sending any emails to anyone.

I accept no responsibility for the misuse of this code, accidental or deliberate by anyone.

## The Potential
Combined with a large dataset of customer behavior, it is trivially easy to find enormous amounts of money that has falled through the cracks no matter how good a job a business is doing.

I personally like combining this concept with Astria, another project of mine. It allows a very clean interface to the data which makes the process of deploying these campaigns trivial.

There is also enormous potential for internal development within companies wherever a problem or error can be found by a query.
